# Gate-Level-CAD-Tool-Design
To implement a simple hierarchical gate-level schematic CAD tool as a case study.
we do a case study for Gate level schematic CAD tool Design.
We are provided with the sample Tcl/Tk codes and on running the Tcl/Tk file we see a CAD tool to provide hierarchical Gate level schematics. In the tutorial, we implement it on the file RCA16b.gv.
For the project, we modify the code for PRJ16b.gv and the sample Tcl/Tk file provided to us to get the gate-level netlist for PRJ16b.gv file. To do so we first understand the GUI designs and check the synthesized gate level netlist by checking the outputs for RCA16b.gv and its corresponding code.
Given below are the CAD tool results for the file PRJ16b.gv with all completed hierarchical gate-level netlist view.
